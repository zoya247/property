# sync-agent-rules.sh — Generate AI agent config files from AGENTS.md
#
# AGENTS.md is the single source of truth. This script creates copies
# for agents that don't read AGENTS.md natively (Cline, Continue,
# Amazon Q, GitHub Copilot Chat).
#
# Usage:
#   bash scripts/sync-agent-rules.sh
#
# Agents that DON'T need generated files (they read AGENTS.md natively):
#   Codex CLI, OpenCode, Cursor, Windsurf, Copilot Coding Agent,
#   Roo Code, Aider, Augment Code
#
# Agents with their own thin pointer files (created manually):
#   Claude Code  → CLAUDE.md (@AGENTS.md import)
#   Gemini CLI   → GEMINI.md (@AGENTS.md import)
#   Cursor       → .cursor/rules/project.mdc (pointer)
#   Windsurf     → .windsurfrules (pointer)
#   Aider        → .aider.conf.yml (read: [AGENTS.md])
